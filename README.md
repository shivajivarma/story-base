Story Base
==========
Hi,

'Story Base' is a repository of moral stories.

Finding time for reading can often be a difficult task for many people with hectic and busy schedules. Committing oneself to a novel often involves a major investment of time and daily distractions, and tasks interfere with the ability to complete a novel in a timely fashion. Short stories are designed to be read in one sitting. As such, short stories can be easily read on the morning commute, on a lunch break or in the evening. Reading short stories helps to establish a reading schedule or routine. Short stories provide ample opportunities to increase your knowledge about different cultures and different lifestyles. They add to a person's general knowledge and understanding of the world.

With Regards,
